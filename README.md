# Mexican Restaurant Ratings
Expository Data Analysis of different Mexican restaurants and how they are being rated.


I've gotten to a conclusion that most of the customers of a restaurants are people of the young adult age category (20 - 30yrs), single and medium budget.

In this case of a Mexican restaurant, majority of these customers are students.

And these dashboard is focused on the ratings of the 130 total restaurants in 4 cities of Mexico offering a total of 23 cuisines. The ratings were based on the customer satisfaction in food and how they are being served.

Undoubtedly the Mexican cuisine is the top most preferred cuisine and Tortas Locas Hipocampo is the best restaurants by customer satisfaction.

A lot of more insights to feed your eyes when you take a look.
